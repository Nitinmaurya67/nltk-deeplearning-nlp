Welcome to my personal learning project where I explore the fundamentals of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using **NLTK** and **Deep Learning** techniques. This repository serves as a hands-on guide to understand and implement various NLP tasks.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project covers essential NLP tasks such as:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words or sentences.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering out common words that don't add significant meaning.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form.
- **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their base form.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical group of words.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detecting entities like names, dates, and locations.

Additionally, I delve into **Deep Learning** approaches for more advanced NLP applications.
