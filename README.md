Welcome to my personal learning project where I explore the fundamentals of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using **NLTK** and **Deep Learning** techniques. This repository serves as a hands-on guide to understand and implement various NLP tasks.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project covers essential NLP tasks such as:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking raw text into smaller units like words, sentences, or sub-words.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering out common, frequently occurring words that typically don't carry significant semantic meaning.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to a crude, base or root form by removing suffixes.
- **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their meaningful base or dictionary form (lemma), considering context.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)**: Identifying the grammatical role of each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
- **N-Grams**: A contiguous sequence of $n$ items (words or characters) from a text sample.
- **Count Vectorizer**: A method to convert text into a matrix of token counts, forming numerical features.
- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**: The process of identifying the correct meaning (sense) of a word in its specific context.

Additionally, I delve into **Deep Learning** approaches for more advanced NLP applications.
